# Capstone Project: Web App with API Integration, Authentication, and RESTful Routes

## Requirements

- [ ] Wireframes: Create wireframes for your web app, including the main components and layout. This includes components and their hierarchy and data flow. (Use this when you plan out your components and create stories in StoryBook.)
- [ ] At least 3 pages: Create at least 3 pages for your web app. This should include a home page, a page for your API integration and an about page. (You can add more pages if you like.)
- [ ] Test tools: Use StoryBook to test your ALL your components (100% coverage). (Bonus if you use Jest and React Testing Library, too)
- [ ] Thoughtful design: Use Tailwind CSS to style your web app. (Bonus if you use a CSS framework like Daisy UI or shadcn/ui.)
- [ ] API Integration: Integrate an API into your project. This should be an API that requires and API key hidden behind a proxy server. You can use `deno.com/deploy` or the `/api` route in your Next.js project.
- [ ] Authentication: Implement authentication in your project. This can be done with Supabase.
- [ ] Persistent Data: Use a database to store data in your project. This can be done with Supabase or KV storage in Vercel or Deno Deploy.
- [ ] RESTful Routes: Implement RESTful routes in your project. This should include at least one route for each CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete). (Try for Create and Read, at least. Then add Update and Delete if you have time.)
