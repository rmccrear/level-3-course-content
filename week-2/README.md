# Week 2 - Next.js Assignments

Through these assignments, you will develop foundational skills in **Next.js** for building modern web applications. Specifically, you will:

- **Create and manage pages**: Learn how to build multi-page websites and route between them in a Next.js environment.
- **Work with state management**: Use the `useState` hook to handle and update dynamic data, such as counters or other interactive elements.
- **Handle user interactions**: Implement event handlers to manage user input and actions, such as button clicks, ensuring smooth, functional interactions.
- **Integrate styling**: Apply **Bootstrap** for responsive, grid-based design, and explore adding your own custom CSS to enhance the UI.
- **Work with static assets**: Manage static resources, like images, by organizing them in the **public/** directory and referencing them in your project.
- **Ensure clean functionality**: Learn best practices to prevent undesired behaviors, like counters going negative, and how to test and debug applications.
- **Optional enhancements**: Experiment with additional features like resetting counters, customizing increments, and integrating fun libraries like **cowsay** for a richer user experience.

These assignments aim to give you a solid foundation in building user-friendly, interactive, and well-structured web applications using Next.js.

### Summary of Learning Objectives for Both Assignments:

---

#### **Assignment 1: Building a Counter in Next.js**

**Objective**: 
In this assignment, you will build a simple counter application using **Next.js**, learning how to create new pages, manage state with `useState`, and handle user events. The focus will be on implementing basic functionality to increment and decrement a counter, with an additional goal of preventing negative values.

**Key Learning Objectives**:
- Understanding how to create and navigate pages in **Next.js**.
- Learning to manage state using the `useState` hook in **React**.
- Implementing event handling for button clicks (incrementing/decrementing the counter).
- Preventing undesired states, such as a counter going below zero.
- Optional stretch goals like adding a reset button or customizing step values for the counter.

#### **Assignment 2: Build a Three-Page Website with Next.js**

**Objective**:
In this assignment, you will build a **three-page website** using **Next.js** and **Bootstrap**. You'll create a **splash page**, an **about page**, and a **gallery page**. The focus is on using Bootstrap for styling and organizing static assets like images within the `public/` directory. There is also a bonus challenge to integrate the **cowsay** library and write custom CSS.

**Key Learning Objectives**:
- Learning how to structure a multi-page website in **Next.js**.
- Using **Bootstrap** to apply responsive and grid-based styling to your pages.
- Managing static assets like images by placing them in the **`public/`** directory and using them in your components.
- Optionally, experimenting with additional features like **cowsay** and custom CSS to enhance the user experience.
