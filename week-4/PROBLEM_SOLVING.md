# The Counting Queues

## More on Stacks and Queues

Recall that stacks are FIFO.

Recall that queues are LIFO.

Stacks have the methods `push` and `pop`.

Queues have the methods `enqueue` and `dequeue`.

## Problem Set 1

How do you tell if two queues are equal? Use only queue methods.

How do you tell if two stacks are equal? Use only queue methods.

Imagine a two queues of ice cream customers. Can you count if the number of pistachio ice cream orders is the same in both queues?

Imagine a stack of two decks of cards. How can you tell if both have the same number of aces?

Think of another practical application of stacks or queues and write a question about it.

Share and try to solve each other's questions.

## Application

Choose one of the problems you solved. Write a program that solves the problem.

You may use the Stacks and Queues classes from a previous lesson. Or you may write new ones this time.

Be sure to only use stack and queue methods.
