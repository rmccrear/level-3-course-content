# Week 4 Assignment

## Fetching Data from an API

Fetching data from an API is a common task in web development. In this exercise, you will learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in your components using React hooks.

The challenge will be using hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` to fetch data from an API. You will likely not understand the entire process at first, but that's okay. The goal is to expose yourself to React hooks. 

Take notes, and bookmark the documentation you need. As you practice more, you will become more comfortable with these concepts.

## Objective

Update your Cats Cats Cats project to access an API and display the data in your components.

The API you will be using is here (you may change the breed to any breed you like):

    https://cats-cats-cats-demo.deno.dev/cats/abyssinian

Use the fetch API, useEffect, and useState to fetch the data and display it in your components.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you will be challenged to use documentation to learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in your components. You will need to use the fetch API, useEffect, and useState to accomplish this task.

You are welcome to ask questions and work together to achieve this goal.

## Stretch Goals

### Stretch Goal 1 Muli-cat

Make new page called something like `cats` or `more-cats` that requests an array instead of a single object. You can use the endpoint with a query parameter of `multi_cat=true` to get multiple cats. For example, you will get cats breeds that contain the substring "bur":

    https://cats-cats-cats-demo.deno.dev/cats/bur?multi_cat=true

### Stretch Goal 2 Error handling or loading state

Watch the video from the reading on how to handle errors and/or loading states. Implement this in your project.

### Stretch Goal 3 Custom API

Try to use a different API to fetch data. You can use any open API you like. Don't use API's with authentication for this exercise.
