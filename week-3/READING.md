Imagine you are tasked with implementing your Level 2 Capstone project in React. (You may select just one page--the one with fetch!)

What JSON does your API return? Give an example. It's OK to truncate the JSON if it is overly large.

- FilterableProductTable
- SearchBar
- ProductTable
- ProductCategoryRow
- ProductRow
