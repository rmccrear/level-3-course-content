# Components and Props and Tailwind, Oh My!

In this exercise, you'll be working with components and props in React. You'll also get some hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS to style your components.

## Week 3 Exercise Objectives

We will be planning and building a React app in order to understand common patterns in React. We will also be learning how to use Tailwind CSS to style our components.

- Day 1: JavaScript Practice
- Day 2: Part 0 - [Planning](part-0-planning.md)
- Day 3: Part 1 - [Splash Page with Tailwind CSS](part-1-setup.md)
- Day 4: Part 2 - [Components and Props](part-2-components.md)

### Day 1: JavaScript Syntax and React Components

JavaScript Practice for Week 3

This is a separate exercise to practice JavaScript syntax and concepts that will be useful in the React exercises.

See [JavaScript Practice](./javascript-practice.md) for the JavaScript practice exercise.

#### Learning Objectives:

- **Practice JavaScript syntactic features**: Gain familiarity with common JavaScript syntax used in React by completing functions in `syntax-practice.js`.
  
- **Build and extend React components**: Apply React patterns to create and render new components, using props for customization in `react-practice/index.js`.

- **Integrate TailwindCSS for styling**: Learn how TailwindCSS classes are used within React components to style elements, and explore how it is set up in the project.

### Day 2: Planning out a React Project

See [part-0-planning.md](part-0-planning.md) for the planning exercise.

#### Learning Objectives:

- **Component-based design**: Analyze a webpage mockup, break down its layout, and identify reusable components for a structured React project.

- **Data mapping**: Learn to map data from a JSON file to individual components, ensuring that each part of the UI receives the correct data.

- **Project planning and documentation**: Develop a clear project plan by listing components and their data needs, and document the project structure in a `README.md` file for better organization.

### Day 3: Building a Splash Page with Tailwind CSS

See [part-1-setup.md](part-1-setup.md) for the setup exercise.

#### Learning Objectives:

- **Setting up Tailwind CSS**: Configure Tailwind CSS in a React project to enable rapid styling and customization.

- **Building components with Tailwind**: Apply Tailwind CSS classes to style components and create a visually appealing splash page.

- **Testing and debugging**: Practice testing your work as you progress, ensuring that the components render correctly and the styles are applied as expected.

## Day 4 Components and Props

See [part-2-components.md](part-2-components.md) for the component exercise.

### Learning Objectives:

- **Build component-based architecture**: Learn to create and organize components in **Next.js** to display data from a mock JSON file.
  
- **Work with props**: Pass data between components using props to display dynamic content such as cat images and details.
  
- **Incremental development and testing**: Apply an iterative approach to coding by testing each step and committing changes frequently to safeguard progress.
