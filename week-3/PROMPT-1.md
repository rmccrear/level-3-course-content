Step 1: Examine the Mockup in `mock-up-single-cat.png`. And the data in `data/cat-data.json`.

Step 2: Open the Mockup in a drawing program and draw boxes around the different sections of the page. These will be the components you will create.

Step 3: Make a list of the components you will need to create. For example, you will need a `CatImage` component to display the cat image.

Step 4: Identify the data that will be passed to each component. For example, the `CatImage` component will need the URL of the cat image. Next to each entry in your list of components, write down the data that it requires. (Note: all the data you need should be coming from `data/cat-data.json`)

Step 5: Add these to a README.md file. You will include this in your repo after you create it.

Step 6: Start coding! Look at the next section for guidance.
